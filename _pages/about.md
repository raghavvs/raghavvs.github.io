I am a first year masters student studying Control Systems in the department of Aerospace Engineering, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am primarily interested in working on control algorithm development, modeling of system dynamics and to incorporate machine learning into control systems for unidentifiable dynamics. I am interested in working at the intersection of control systems and machine learning, particularly, reinforcement learning. I am keen on understanding the practical challenges of implementing learning-based control algorithms on real-physical systems.
