![Overview](/images/t8.png "Overview")

This work was done at Bretl's Research Group, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign alongside Holly Dinkel.

The primary goal involved determining the relative pose between two industrial robotic arms (ABB IRB120) with millimeter accuracy. The setup of the worksapce: two robotic arms, one equiped with a Intel RealSense D435 stereo-vision camera and a OnRobot 2FG7 Gripper on the other arm.

Please refer to the previous work to understand the prior status of the arms.

This kind of calibration is commonly referred as AXB = YCZ multi-robot calibration.
