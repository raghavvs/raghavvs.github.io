This study presents the creation of a von Kármán vortex for a vibrating piezoelectric energy harvester device using a bluff body i.e., a cylinder. The effects of two parameters, which are the diameter and the position of the cylinder, were investigated on the Kármán vortex profile and the amplitude of the vibrating flexible piezoelectric material, respectively. A simulation was conducted to determine the effect of the creation of the Kármán vortex by the bluff body. A piezoelectric energy harvester is attached and vibrated from the vortices generated within the turbulent boundary layers. One of the applications is, this vibration provides a measured output voltage and can be used in power sensors.
